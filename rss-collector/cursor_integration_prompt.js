/**
 * I want to integrate a Gaming RSS Feed Collector into my Deno/Fresh project.
 * 
 * The collector should:
 * 1. Fetch RSS feeds from major gaming news sites (IGN, Kotaku, Polygon, GameSpot, etc.)
 * 2. Parse and normalize the feeds into a consistent format
 * 3. Display the latest gaming news on my blog
 * 
 * I have a directory structure with these components:
 * - gaming_rss_project/feeds/gaming_feeds.json - Configuration with RSS feed sources
 * - gaming_rss_project/core/ - Core modules (fetcher.ts, parser.ts, normalizer.ts)
 * - gaming_rss_project/utils/ - Utility functions (cache.ts, filters.ts, sorters.ts)
 * - gaming_rss_project/fresh/components/ - Fresh components
 * - gaming_rss_project/mod.ts - Main entry point
 * 
 * Please help me:
 * 1. Create an API route in my Fresh project to serve the gaming news data
 * 2. Implement the GameNewsFeed component in my blog's main page
 * 3. Add proper styling for the news feed
 * 4. Set up caching to improve performance
 * 
 * My Fresh project is located at [YOUR_PROJECT_PATH].
 * I want to display the 10 latest gaming news items on my homepage.
